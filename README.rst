QHL\_Exponentiation
===================

Exponentiation functionality for Quantum Hamiltonian Learning.

To install this suite, clone the repository, go to the folder. Then
type:

::

    sudo pip install -e . 

Within Python:

::

    import hamiltonian_exponentiation

Available functions
-------------------

1. random\_hamiltonian(num\_qubits)

-  gives a Hamiltonian matrix generated by random tensor products of
   Paulis.

2. exp\__i\_h\_t(hamiltonian, time, plus\_or\_minus precision)

-  Computes e^{-iHt}
-  hamiltonian: Hamiltonian matrix to be exponentiated.
-  time: time generated by heuristic.
-  plus\_or\_minus: +1.0 to compute e^{iHt}; -1.0 for e^{-iHt}. Default is -1.0.
-  precision: when matrix elements are changed by this amount or
   smaller, exponenitation is truncated.

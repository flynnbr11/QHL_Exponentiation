# QHL_Exponentiation
Exponentiation functionality for Quantum Hamiltonian Learning. Custom function for computing e^{-iHt} or e^{iHt} 
where H is a sparse, Hermitian matrix. If H is not Hermitian, the calculation will be incorrect in general.


To install this suite, clone the repository, go to the folder. Then type:
``` 
sudo pip install -e . 
```

Within Python: 
```
import hamiltonian_exponentiation
```

## Available functions
1. random_hamiltonian(num_qubits)
  * gives a Hamiltonian matrix generated by random tensor products of Paulis.
  
2. exp_i_h_t(hamiltonian, time, precision)
  * Computes e^{-iHt} or e^{+iHt}.
  * hamiltonian: Hamiltonian matrix to be exponentiated. 
  * time: time generated by heuristic.
  * plus_or_minus: +1.0 to compute e^{iHt}; -1.0 for e^{-iHt}. Default is -1.0.
  * precision: when matrix elements are changed by this amount or smaller, exponenitation is truncated at that step of summation.
